# Multi-classification-of-Sugarcane-Disease-Using-Transfer-Learning
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust multi-class classification model capable of identifying the health status of sugarcane leaves based on the presence of red rot and red rust disease. With three distinct classes involved, namely "Healthy", "Red Rot", "Red Rust" potential classes.
